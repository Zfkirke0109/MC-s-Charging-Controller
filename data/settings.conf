# A uevent file unites some properties
## related to a 'device', a 'module' or something in sysfs
## and a switch is a file to override those, unless read-only

# For us, we parse uevent file to detect battery level, battery health and whether is charging or not
## and edit switches for to turn charging ON / OFF

# Like for my device ( LeEco Le Max 2 x829, RR-5.8.5-Final Official ), those are
##    uevent=/sys/devices/soc/qpnp-smbcharger-17/power_supply/battery/uevent
##    switch_1=/sys/devices/soc/qpnp-smbcharger-17/power_supply/battery/battery_charging_enabled 1 0
##    switch_2=/sys/devices/soc/qpnp-smbcharger-17/power_supply/battery/charging_enabled 1 0

# An important thang,
## charging can alse be turned ON / OFF using only one switch
## but there is some undesirable effect on battery
## when multiple switches like 'batt_slate_mode' and 'store_mode'
## are available, to prevent this, I have chosen to utilize all the switches
