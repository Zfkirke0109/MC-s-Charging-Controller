# An example for uevent is '/sys/devices/soc/qpnp-smbcharger-17/power_supply/battery/uevent', and for a switch is '/sys/devices/soc/qpnp-smbcharger-17/power_supply/battery/battery_charging_enabled 1 0'

# A uevent file contains some properties related to the 'device', and a switch is to override those props ( unless read-only )

# In our case, uevent tells us battery status ( batt_level, battery health and whether is charging or not ), and switches are for to turn charging ON / OFF
