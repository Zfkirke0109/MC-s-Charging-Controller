# Examples
##    uevent=/sys/devices/soc/qpnp-smbcharger-17/power_supply/battery/uevent
##    switch=/sys/devices/soc/qpnp-smbcharger-17/power_supply/battery/battery_charging_enabled 1 0

# A uevent file contains some properties
## related to a 'device', a 'module' or something in sysfs
## and a switch is a file to override those props, unless read-only

# In our case, uevent tells us battery status
## i.e., battery level, battery health and whether is charging or not
## and switches are for to turn charging ON / OFF

# Charging can be turned ON / OFF using only one switch, too
## but there are some common issues when multiple switches
## like 'batt_slate_mode' and 'store_mode' are available
## to overcome this, I have chosen to utilize all the switches
